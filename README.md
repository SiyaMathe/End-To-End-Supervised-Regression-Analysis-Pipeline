# End-To-End-Supervised-Regression-Analysis-Pipeline
# Prediction of Burn Area using Meteorological Data

This project focuses on building a regression model to predict the burned area of forest fires using meteorological and spatiotemporal data. The dataset used covers forest fires in Portugal’s Montesinho Natural Park between 2000 and 2003.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a reusable end-to-end regression framework that can be deployed in real-world scenarios. The project emphasizes the use of the Scikit-Learn library to automate data preprocessing, model building, and prediction.

### Dataset

The dataset contains meteorological and spatiotemporal data for 517 forest fire incidents, with 13 attributes for each incident. The target attribute is ‘area’ (total burned area in hectares). The attributes include:

-   **Meteorological Data:** temp, RH (relative humidity), wind (speed), rain (accumulated precipitation over the last 30 minutes), DMC, DC, ISI, FFMC (components of the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index).
-   **Spatiotemporal Data:** month, day, X (X-coordinate), Y (Y-coordinate).

### Challenges

The dataset presents several challenges:

-      Highly skewed target variable ('area').
-      Presence of extreme outliers.
-      Potential for underfitting or overfitting.
-      Limited number of data points.

## Project Structure

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`). The notebook is structured as follows:

1.  **Data Loading and Initial Exploration:**
    -      Loading the dataset.
    -      Handling missing values.
    -      Exploring the distribution of attributes.
    -   Handling categorical data
2.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    -      Outlier removal.
    -      Stratified shuffle splitting for train and test sets.
    -      Feature engineering (e.g., creating temperature bins).
    -      Correlation analysis.
    -      Custom transformers (AttributeDeleter, TopFeatureSelector).
    -      Pipelines for numerical and categorical data preprocessing.
    -   ColumnTransformer for full data preprocessing.
3.  **Model Selection and Training:**
    -      Trying various regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, XGBoost).
    -      Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.
    -      Feature importance analysis.
4.  **Model Evaluation:**
    -      Evaluating model performance using RMSE.
    -      Cross-validation.
    -   Confidence interval for the final predictions
5.  **Final Model and Deployment:**
    -      Selecting the best model.
    -      Creating a final pipeline for prediction.
    -      Demonstrating model prediction on new data.
